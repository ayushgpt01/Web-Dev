        <em>Snakes and Ladders</em> (Gerry Rafferty album)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Snakes and Ladders is the fourth album by Gerry Rafferty. It was
        released in 1980, following the success of his previous two albums, City
        to City and Night Owl. The album charted at No. 15 in the UK but only
        reached No. 61 in the US. The album was released on CD in 1998 [EMI 7
        46609-2] but deleted soon after that, and it got reissued on CD on
        August 2012 as a 2-CD set with "Sleepwalking." Some of the songs are
        available on compilation albums. Four of the songs, "The Garden of
        England", "I was a Boy Scout", "Welcome to Hollywood" and "Bring it all
        Home" were recorded at Beatles producer George Martin's AIR studio in
        Montserrat. All the songs were original Rafferty compositions, though
        one &#45; "Johnny's Song" &#45; was a remake of a song which had been
        previously released by his former band Stealers Wheel, and another &#45;
        "Didn't I" &#45; was a remake of a song from Rafferty's 1971 album Can I
        Have My Money Back?.
